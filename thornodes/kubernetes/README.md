# Deploy - K8 Cluster

## **Deploy a Kubernetes cluster**

In order to deploy all the different services and provide a high availability environment to operate your node, Kubernetes is the preferred scheduling platform. Any production-grade Kubernetes cluster can be used to run and deploy a THORNode. You need your Kubernetes provider to offer external load balancers services type features. AWS, Azure, Digital Ocean, GCE, OpenStack are compatible with external load balancers.

{% hint style="info" %}
Terraform is a type of domain-specific language \(DSL\) used to describe through code infrastructure. It designed to make it easier to create/destroy infrastructure hosted locally or by a provider such as AWS or others.
{% endhint %}

This Terraform deployment will deploy a Kubernetes cluster using your VPS provider credentials and EKS service. The cluster will have autoscaling capabilities, which means you donâ€™t have to deal with how many nodes you need to deploy to run your THORNode services.

All the default configurations used in these instructions are for a production environment with enough resources to run your THORNode in good conditions.

## Steps

There are three important steps to getting your node set up, deployed and churned in. 

1. [Setting up Cluster](setup.md)
2. [Deploying THORNode Services](../deploying.md)
3. [Joining \("Churning In"\)](../joining.md)

### Repository Management

Your repository should be organised as follows:

```text
./thornode-ops
  |./cluster-launcher
  |./node-launcher
```

All of your set up commands are run in `cluster-launcher` and all of your deploying/joining/managing/leaving commands are run from `node-launcher`

### Running Two or More Nodes

{% hint style="danger" %}
To prevent a catastrophic mistake in handling multiple nodes, set them up on different machines, or use different user profiles on your machine, or in the least, use different repos:
{% endhint %}

```text
./thornode-ops
  |./cluster-launcher
  |./node-launcher
./thornode-ops2
  |./cluster-launcher
  |./node-launcher
```

All of your commands can now be run separately. 

{% hint style="info" %}
It is heavily advised to not set up nodes on the same provider. Deploy 1 node on AWS, 1 node on Digital Ocean etc.
